# Quick Answer: Should I Keep the Migration Folder?

## TL;DR: YES - KEEP IT ✅

---

## Question:
> "Can I delete the `supabase/migrations/` folder?"

## Answer:
**NO - The migration folder must be kept permanently.**

---

## Why?

### Your Supabase Migration is COMPLETE and ACTIVE

1. ✅ **Migration is complete** - Google Sheets fully replaced with Supabase
2. ✅ **Migrations are in use** - Your app saves data to Supabase on every form submission
3. ✅ **Migrations define your database** - They are the source of truth for your schema
4. ✅ **Required for deployment** - Any new environment needs these files

---

## What's in the Migration Folder?

```
supabase/migrations/
├── 20250218_init_form_tables.sql         # Creates tables & RLS policies
└── 20250305_save_submission_function.sql # Creates save function
```

These files:
- Create your database tables
- Set up security policies
- Define indexes for performance
- Install the transactional save function

---

## What Happens If I Delete It?

### ❌ Immediate Problems:
- Documentation becomes invalid (references missing files)
- Can't provision new databases
- Lost source of truth for schema

### ❌ Future Problems:
- Can't recover from database disasters
- Team members can't set up local environments
- Can't recreate production in staging
- No version control for schema changes

---

## Think of Migrations Like:

| They Are | They Are NOT |
|----------|-------------|
| ✅ Source code for your database | ❌ Temporary setup files |
| ✅ Required for deployment | ❌ One-time installation scripts |
| ✅ Version control for schema | ❌ Documentation only |
| ✅ Infrastructure as code | ❌ Optional backups |

---

## When to Use the Migrations?

### Every time you:
- Set up a new Supabase instance
- Deploy to a new environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Onboard a new team member
- Need to recreate your database
- Want to understand the schema

### How to apply:
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI (recommended)
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migrations
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20250218_init_form_tables.sql
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20250305_save_submission_function.sql
```
