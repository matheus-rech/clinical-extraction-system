## 🔄 Relationship to Modular Version

This original file was transformed into **30+ modular TypeScript files** in the main `src/` directory:

```
Original HTML (2,130 lines)
        ↓
    Modularized
        ↓
30+ TypeScript modules + SCSS
```

## 📊 Comparison

| Aspect | Original (This File) | Modular (src/) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Files | 1 HTML file | 30+ TS/SCSS files |
| Lines | 2,130 | ~2,500 (organized) |
| Type Safety | None | Full TypeScript |
| Maintainability | Hard | Easy |
| Testing | Difficult | Ready |
| Build | None | Vite |

## 🚀 Using the Backup

To use the original standalone version:

1. Open this HTML file directly in a browser
2. No build step needed
3. Everything works standalone

However, for development, use the modular version:

```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes
